# Customer Feedback Page

For this task, I have used React, Typescript, Jest, and React Testing Library.

# **Design**

- For the user interface, the review form is hidden on the initial page load, when the 'write a review' CTA button gets clicked the form section is rendered below the header. 


- Set button color according to page status to lead natural attention to important CTA buttons.

- A donut chart and total number of reviews are indicated on the Dashboard section

- All the comments are rendered in the latest order

# **How to start**

To run the app, please install all necessary Node modules first then run the server and the client, to do so, run the following command

```
 yarn install 
 yarn start
```

**Client** should be running at http://localhost:3000/



# **Testing**

To run tests, please run the following command

```
 yarn test
```

# **Whatâ€™s left to improve**
 - Add filter for the review list which allows users can see specific reviews such as filter reviews only with 1 star
 
 - Make review saved notification disappeared after a few sec to increase the visibility of the page.
